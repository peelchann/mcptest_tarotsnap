# ðŸ”® TarotSnap Memory & Relationship System - Master Plan

**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Vision:** Transform TarotSnap into a personal spiritual advisor with memory  
**Status:** Planning Phase - Ready for Implementation  
**Based on:** Sequential thinking analysis and comprehensive planning session  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **VISION: THE REMEMBERING READER**

Transform TarotSnap from a one-off reading tool into a **personal spiritual advisor with memory** - an AI that builds genuine relationships with users over time, remembering their journey and providing increasingly personalized guidance.

### Core Concept
Create an AI tarot reader that:
- **Remembers** past readings, themes, and personal growth
- **References** specific previous sessions naturally ("Last time we spoke about your career transition...")
- **Builds** on previous advice and guidance ("How did that meditation practice work out for you?")
- **Tracks** progress and celebrates growth ("I see tremendous growth in your confidence since our first session")
- **Adapts** reading style to each user's preferences learned over time
- **Develops** deeper understanding of each user's life patterns
