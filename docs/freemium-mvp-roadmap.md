# TarotSnap Freemium MVP Roadmap
## Live Functional Website Strategy

**Strategy:** Build live AI tarot reading website ‚Üí Gather real usage data ‚Üí Convert engaged users to paid tiers  
**Philosophy:** Experience-driven validation over interest-based signups  
**Timeline:** 4-week MVP with incremental revenue milestones

---

## üéØ **Strategic Foundation**

### **Core Hypothesis**
```
"People will repeatedly use AI tarot readings if the experience feels authentic and valuable"
```

### **Validation Approach**
```
Phase 1: Prove usage (do people actually use it?)
Phase 2: Prove engagement (do they return?)  
Phase 3: Prove willingness to pay (will engaged users upgrade?)
```

### **Success Metrics Hierarchy**
```
Primary: Daily Active Users (engagement over signups)
Secondary: Session duration & return rate (value delivery)
Tertiary: Sharing/viral coefficient (organic growth)
Ultimate: Conversion to paid (business viability)
```
