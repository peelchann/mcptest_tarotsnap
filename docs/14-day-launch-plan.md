# 14-Day Launch Plan for TarotSnap (AI-Powered Tarot MVP)

**Goal:** Launch a public-facing MVP of TarotSnap (an AI tarot reading web app) in 2 weeks and acquire the first 10â€“100 users, while working full-time.

**Strategy:** This plan breaks down tasks day-by-day, leveraging no-code/low-code tools and AI services for maximum efficiency.

---

## **Day 1: Kickoff & Planning**

### Define MVP Scope
- Clarify what's essential for launch
- Core feature: AI-driven tarot reading
- Defer nice-to-haves (detailed profiles, complex spreads) until traction is proven
- Keep tech minimal â€“ use existing front-end UI and plan lightweight backend

### Choose Key Tools & Platforms
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI GPT-4 API for robust text generation
- **Hosting:** Vercel for front-end + serverless functions
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase (Postgres + auth) or Firebase
- **Decision:** Stick to one that's quick to implement

### Plan User Registration Approach
- **Option 1:** Skip full accounts, just collect emails for onboarding
- **Option 2:** Use plug-and-play auth (Supabase/Firebase) vs coding from scratch
- **Recommendation:** Start with email capture only for speed

### Allocate Budget & Resources
- **Total Budget:** HKD $10k (~$1280)
- **Breakdown:**
  - ~$200 for API costs/subscriptions
  - ~$200 for marketing (ads)
  - Reserve funds for outsourcing tasks
- **Outsourcing Platforms:** Upwork, Fiverr for AI integration, design, quick fixes

### Draft Timeline
- Map out next 14 days with specific daily goals
- Block evening/early morning time for TarotSnap (accounting for full-time job)
