## Latest Updates

### January 22, 2025 - Ultra-Wide Layout Fix ✅
**HERO-CONTAINER Task Completed** - Fixed ultra-wide monitor layout issues
- **Problem:** Hero content stretching to viewport extremes on ≥1920px monitors with massive dead zones
- **Root Cause:** No max-width container constraints causing content to span full viewport width
- **Solution Applied:**
  - Added Tailwind `container mx-auto` with `max-w-7xl` constraint  
  - Implemented responsive gap controls: `2xl:gap-20` for ultra-wide spacing
  - Updated card sizing: `w-[clamp(160px,18vw,220px)]` for better viewport scaling
  - Added `2xl:px-0` for optimal ultra-wide padding
- **Testing:** Verified on 2560x1440 and 3840x2160 resolutions
- **Result:** Hero content now remains visually connected and centered on all monitor sizes
