# Progress Log - Sprint 2: Golden Tarot UI Revamp

## Completed Tasks:

### Stage 1: Tailwind Config & Initial Palette Update
- **Date**: 2024-05-16
- **Changes**:
    - Added new color tokens to `tailwind.config.js`:
        - `agatha-navy: '#1E1E3F'`
        - `agatha-mid: '#2E2E5F'`
        - `gold-400: '#C8AD7F'`
        - `gold-500: '#B8986A'`
    - Updated body background in `app/layout.tsx` to `bg-gradient-to-b from-agatha-navy to-agatha-mid`.
    - Updated site metadata title in `app/layout.tsx` to "TarotSnap".

### Stage 2: Homepage Revamp (Hero, 3-Card Spread, CTAs)
- **Date**: 2024-05-16
- **Changes (`app/page.tsx`)**:
    - **Hero Section**:
        - Changed H1 title to "TarotSnap", centered, styled with `font-witchcraft` (Cinzel), `text-[3rem]`, `text-gold-400`.
        - Subtitle centered, `text-[1.25rem]`.
        - Hero content wrapped in `max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center`.
        - Dividers accented with `gold-400`.
    - **3-Card Spread Panel**:
        - Removed `TarotCarousel`.
        - Added a 3-column grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`) for card spreads.
        - Spread cards styled with `border border-gold-400 rounded-lg`, `shadow-lg`.
        - Card hover/focus: `hover:scale-105 hover:ring-4 hover:ring-opacity-40 ring-gold-400`.
        - (Note: Placeholders used for `SpreadCard` components and card images).
    - **CTA Buttons**:
        - Restyled buttons ("Draw a Card", "Begin Reading", "Deep Dive", "About the Craft", "Begin Divination") to `bg-gold-400 text-[#1E1E3F] hover:bg-gold-500 px-6 py-3 rounded-xl font-semibold`.

### Stage 3: Sidebar Icon Toning
- **Date**: 2024-05-16
- **Changes (`app/components/ScrollingSymbols.tsx`)**:
    - Reduced opacity of rune symbols to `opacity-20`.
    - Changed rune fill color to `text-gold-300`.
    - Removed dynamic HSL color and text shadow for simplification.

### Stage 4: Refactoring and Image Integration
- **Date**: 2024-05-17 (Assuming current date for new entries)
- **Changes**:
    - **Created `app/components/SpreadCard.tsx`**:
        - A reusable component to display individual tarot spread options (Single, Three Card, Witch's Cross).
        - Takes props for title, description, button text, link, image source, and image alt text.
        - Styled with Tailwind CSS, consistent with the gold and navy theme.
    - **Updated `app/data/cards.ts`**:
        - Changed `imagePath` property for Major Arcana cards to use `.png` extensions and reflect renamed image files (e.g., `/images/tarot/the_fool.png`).
        - Updated fallback image path logic in `getRandomCard` and `getRandomCards` to use `.png`.
        - **Note**: Manual verification and update of all Minor Arcana `imagePath` entries and corresponding physical image files are still required by the user.
    - **Refactored `app/page.tsx`**:
        - Replaced the previous hardcoded spread display sections with the new `SpreadCard` component.
        - Fetches representative card images from `cards.ts` for display on the homepage.
        - Uses fallback image (`/images/tarot/default.png`) if specific card images are not found.
    - **Created `docs/SpreadCard.md`**:
        - Added documentation for the new `SpreadCard` component, detailing its props, usage, and styling notes.

## Issues & Observations:
- **Image 404 Errors**: The local development server is currently reporting 404 errors for tarot card PNG images (e.g., `the_fool.png`, `judgement.png`). This indicates an issue with either the image file locations in `public/images/tarot/`, incorrect filenames, or that the dev server needs a restart after file changes. **This must be resolved before committing and pushing to ensure images display correctly.**

## Next Steps / TODO:
- **User Action**: Verify all tarot card PNG images are correctly placed in `public/images/tarot/` and named to match `imagePath` in `app/data/cards.ts` (including all Minor Arcana).
- **User Action**: Ensure `default.png` exists in `public/images/tarot/` or update the fallback in `app/page.tsx`.
- **User Action**: Restart the Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) after verifying image files.
- **User Action**: Confirm images are loading correctly on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Add SVG corner decorations to the hero section on `app/page.tsx`.
- Transfer these TODO items to `TODO.txt`.
- Proceed with Git staging and pushing *after* image issues are resolved.
