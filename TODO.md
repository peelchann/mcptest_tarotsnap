## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **API Structure:**
```typescript
POST /api/reading
Body: { question: string, spread?: "single" }
Response: { cards: Card[], interpretation: string, timestamp: Date }
// Claude excels at structured JSON responses with creative content
```

### **Claude-Specific Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/claude.ts
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

export async function generateTarotReading(question: string) {
  const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens: 1000,
    temperature: 0.8, // Higher creativity for mystical content
    messages: [{
      role: "user", 
      content: tarotPrompt + question
    }]
  });
  return response.content;
}
```

### **Cost Optimization:**
```typescript
// Claude pricing: ~$3 per 1000 input tokens, ~$15 per 1000 output tokens
// Estimated cost per reading: $0.012-0.035 (competitive with GPT-4)
// Budget: $50-100/month covers 1500-4000 readings
```

### **Rate Limiting Strategy:**
```typescript
// IP-based for anonymous users
// User-based for registered users
// 3 readings per day for free tier
```

### **Analytics Events:**
```typescript
// Track: reading_completed, question_submitted, user_returned
// Metrics: session_duration, bounce_rate, conversion_funnel
```

## 🚨 **RISK MITIGATION**

### **Technical Risks:**
- **OpenAI costs:** Daily usage caps, prompt optimization
- **API reliability:** Error handling, fallback responses
- **Performance:** Caching, optimization

### **Business Risks:**
- **Low engagement:** Rapid iteration based on feedback
- **Competition:** Focus on AI quality and user experience
- **Monetization:** Test willingness to pay early with engaged users
